# What is Kaizen?
In the 1980's Toyota comibined two Japanese words, "Kai" (change) and "Zen" (good), into to a philosophy of continually improving the craft of automobile design and delivery. Many other companies and industries practice Kaizen processes to deliver **value** to their customers. 

At it's core, Kaizen acknowledges that human endeavors rarely reach perfection! However, we can continue to improve ourselves and those around us by focusing our attention.
